# Project Overview:

<b> [WIP:] </b> Establishing Generation + ETL + Reporting on my homelab (Ubuntu server).

<b> [Current stage:] </b> ETL development and dbt model preparation.

  - [x] Initialized
  - [x] Update tables
  - [ ] Complete Web part
- [x] Prepare Python generators
  - [x] Prepare python scripts to generate raw data (`dags/generators`)
  - [ ] Complete diagram with [generator's logic](https://github.com/AntonMiniazev/ampere_project/blob/master/project_images/python_generator_script.svg)
- [x] Deployment
  - [x] Prepare Helm charts

    - [x] Prepare sub-script for Helm charts on master
- [ ] ETL
  - [x] Establish DS â†’ Stage layer
	  - [x] Launch generator DAG (deployed through `dags/my_dags/orders_clients_gen_dag.py`)
    - [x] Launch transfer ingestion DAG (deployed through `dags/my_dags/source_to_minio.py`)
    - [x] Launch MinIO cleaning DAG to remove unnecessary artefacts in RAW and Processing buckets (deployed through `dags/my_dags/cleanup_minio_shapshots.py`)
    - [x] Prepare multi-stage docker image for dbt development (local dev container + dev image for pod to process dbt models) 
    - [x] Create dbt model for processing layer
      - [x] Processing dbt model with tests (deployed through `/workspaces/ampere_project/dbt/models/processing/`)
      - [x] DAG to manage processing dbt model (deployed through `dags/my_dags/dbt_processing_model.py`)
    - [x] Create dbt model for stage pre-business logic layer
      - [x] Pre-BL dbt model (deployed through `dbt/models/business_logic/export_processing_to_mssql.py`)
